🐾 AI-Powered Veterinary Disease Prediction System
📘 Overview

This project is an AI automation system for veterinary clinics designed to assist veterinarians in diagnosing animal diseases efficiently.
It predicts potential diseases based on the symptoms and breed of the animal, then automatically assigns a suitable doctor.
If a doctor is available, the system confirms the appointment; otherwise, the scheduling process is automated for later allocation.
