# Project: AI-based Veterinary Practice Automation
## Problem in Existing System

- Veterinary clinics using Hapivet.ai currently face the following issues:

- Manual Client Communication

- Sending vaccination reminders, follow-ups, and aftercare instructions is mostly manual.

- Leads to missed reminders or inconsistent communication.

- High Administrative Workload

- Staff spend significant time tracking schedules, sending emails/SMS, and answering repetitive client queries.

- Limited AI Assistance

- No integrated AI to answer common pet-care questions automatically.

- Clients often have to call or wait for responses to basic queries like feeding, symptoms, or minor first aid.

- Disconnected Workflow

# Current system lacks continuous automation:

- Client data is not automatically checked for due vaccinations.

- Emails, SMS, and AI responses are not integrated in one flow.

# Impact:

- Reduced client satisfaction.

- Risk of missed vaccinations.

- Inefficient use of staff time.
